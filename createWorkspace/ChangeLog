2020-Feb-10:	1, Change NormFactor range for POI (signal strength) from 0 to 0.5 to reduce the fitting range
		2, Change from Poisson constraint to Gaussian constraint for
		data statistical uncertainties
		3, Make if(dirName != "Nominal" && dirName != "STAT" &&
		dirName.find("UncorrUncertainty") == string::npos &&
		dirName.find("CorrUncertainty") ==string::npos ) in the file
		src/writeSampleXml.cxx to remove SIMPLIFIED scheme
		uncertainties.

2020-Jan-31:	1, Have narrow ranges for Additional scalar as well

2019-Dec-2:	1, There are no big differences between this version and the
writeXmlPackage_splitTotXS apart from using to_String(int) for mHmZd pair
		2, File src/getRangeForFile.cxx is now limitted to Nominal
		only since the low mass input is troublesome
		3, Files with "Loan" are made for narrowed input only, have to
		improve the code later for general case and with config file

2019-Nov-20:	1, Additional scalar now is in as limit on mu. A remapping of
binning on efficiency and acceptance is applied. Must provide correct mapping
and ranging.

2019-Nov-12:	1, do total XS limit without hadding files (split channels)
		


2019-Nov-4: 	1, Modified writeXmlPackage to be able to run different config files for different input sets.
		2, Modified makeBandLimitPlot to read in config files as well.

2019-Oct-7: 	1, Modified src/createOneSignalRootFile.cxx to have mean/sigma from STAT folder and use for TDirectories where mean/sigma are not provided.
		2, Modifed function xmlFile() in main.cxx to have totalXS xml written out for lowMass (skipping rescale,hadd,... procedure as in highMass). Have to fix it for general case.
		3, Modifying makeBandPlots script to be used in general purpose, consider making a config file


2019-Oct-2:	1, Discovered wrong eff in low mass signal root files. Fixed by Peter. Made a script to check input before processing: compareLowmass.C (has to find a place to store it).
		2, bkg histograms now are in the right binnings.
		3, 

2019-Sept-30: 	1, Can make fiducial WS for low mass, with no TDirectoryFiles in bkg root file.
	      	2, Avoided signal mass points are removed at Splitting step.
		3, Bkg file is to be fixed in binnings.
Pay attention for signal:
    int nBin=190;
    double firstBin=0.83;
    double lastBin=19.83;


2019-Sept-29: work with low mass input
2019-Aug-07: split channels DONE
